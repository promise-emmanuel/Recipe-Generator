# Overview
As a software engineer, I am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and work on practical projects that integrate AI with web development. This project is a Recipe Generation & Management System, which allows users to generate unique recipes using AI, save them to a database, and retrieve saved recipes when needed.

The system utilizes an AI model to create new recipes based on user-input ingredients and provides structured output that can be easily displayed as HTML. The goal of this project is to explore backend API development, AI integration, database management, and frontend rendering using JavaScript.
